## 📌 Overview

RLShield Lite demonstrates how **machine learning models are served, ranked, monitored, and evaluated in production**.

Instead of focusing on training models, this project emphasizes:
- ML inference pipelines
- Latency-aware ranking
- Metrics aggregation
- API-first system design

This mirrors **real-world ML platforms** used in large-scale tech companies.

## ✨ Features

- **Inference Simulation**  
  Generates scores, labels (Low / Medium / High), confidence values, and latency to mimic real ML inference.

- **Ranking Logic**  
  Implements a custom weighted ranking function:


weighted_score = score * 0.7 + confidence * 30 - latency_ms * 0.01


- **Persistence**  
Stores all inference decisions in **SQLite** for analysis and evaluation.

- **Metrics Tracking**  
Computes real-time **p95 latency** and

Samajh gaya bhai 🔥
TU CHAHTA HAI: poora README (ALL headings + content) ek hi SINGLE BOX me — taaki one-click copy → paste ho jaaye.
Kuch bhi box ke bahar NAHI hoga.
